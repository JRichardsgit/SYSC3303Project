Reflection on your design - what parts do you like and what parts should be redone

We believe our project was overall done well and met the requirements. We liked the GUI part since it made it easier to
understand whats going on and more user friendly. One thing that can be done better is the effeciency of the scheduler by making it do more
things then the requirements by going above and beyond. Overall, thanks to TA Ian and the team work, the project was done well.
