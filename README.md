# SYSC 3303 Project: L2_G10
## Group Members: Gabriele Sarwar, Jolar Tabungar, James Richards, Akash Joe, Ryan Tordesillas
This project aims to design a real time elevator control system that will quickly and efficiently transport passengers between floors.

## Classes:

### FloorSubsystem
* Acts as the client, sends floor requests to the scheduler for relaying to an elevator, manages the sending and receiving requests for all the floors

#### Floor
* Node of the FloorSubsystem; handles its respective floor requests, has its own floor number and up/down buttons, and floor lamps

### Scheduler
* Acts as the system server and manages interactions between the elevator and floor systems. Once a floor request is received, it is routed to the appropriate elevator and relays the request to the elevator subsystem.

### ElevatorSubsystem 
* Receives relayed floor requests from the scheduler and sends it to the routed elevator node

#### Elevator
* Node of the ElevatorSubsystem; handles it's own movement, opening/closing of doors, keeps track of all pending floor requests, lamps, and updates the scheduler about its status

## Setup Instructions:
In order to run the system on one computer: 
Run > Main as a Java Application

When prompted to input values:
	Select -> Use Defaults

When prompted for selecting the run configurations for the floor subsystem and scheduler:
	Select -> Same Computer As Elevator Subsystem
	Select -> Same Computer As Scheduler

When prompted to select a request file:
	Select -> default_values.txt

Alternatively, 
In order to run the system on separate computers, run each class on its respective computer in the following order
	Run > ElevatorSubsystem.java as a Java Application
	Run > Scheduler.java as a Java Application
	Run > FloorSubsystem.java as a Java Application

When prompted to input values:
	Select -> Use Defaults

When prompted for selecting the run configurations for the floor subsystem and scheduler:
Select -> Separate Computer
Enter the Elevator subsystemâ€™s  IP address
	Select -> Separate Computer
	Enter the Schedulerâ€™s IP address

When prompted to select a request file:
	Select -> default_values.txt



#### System Flow: 
* Floor requests an elevator and sends it to the scheduler
* Scheduler decides which elevator to send the request
* Scheduler relays request to the elevator subsystem
* Elevator subsystem relays it to the appropriate elevator
* Elevator that receives the request responds to the scheduler and updates it about it's status

#### Testing
In order to run the test cases, in Eclipse:
	Run > TestCases.java 

All Tests should pass.
