This project aims to design a real time elevator control system that will quickly and efficiently transport passengers between floors.

Classes:

Scheduler - Acts as the system server and manages interactions between the elevator and floor systems


Elevator - Client, receieves req. from scheduler and sends next floor data to scheduler 


Floor - Client, sends floor data req. along with direction of next floor dest. to scheduler and receives elevator status and direction


Setup Instructions:

1 run Elevator.java
2 run Scheduler.java
3 run Floor.java
